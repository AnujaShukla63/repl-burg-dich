# repl-burg-dich
A replication of the paper Burgstahler and Dichev (1997) for detecting earnings management
This paper helps detect earnings management across firms, but not for a particular firm. This analysis is carried out over some time period like 5 or 10 years. 
Earnings management, in accounting, is the act of intentionally influencing the process of financial reporting to obtain some private gain.
